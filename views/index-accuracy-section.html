        <h2>Accuracy Status/Known Flaws</h2>
        <p>Current goals are to perfectly reproduce Wii U Mii Maker/NNID renders, Mii Studio/Miitomo renders, and Switch icon renders.</p>
        <ul class="left-aligned-ul">
            <li>
            ‚ùå NO PANTS COLORS
            <ul>
                <li>Wii U Mii Maker draws the pants and torso separately but it's one model.</li>
                <li>They are using the skeleton to separate those, so, it depends on this:</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
            ‚ùå Body is not scaled using bone weights from skeleton
            <ul>
                <li>This is why the body's arms may look a little wonky and unnatural.</li>
                <li>Need to use the skeleton from MiiBodyMiddle.bfres (MK8/Wii U Mii Maker)
                <li class="small">So I need to find something that extracts these from the bfres. The <a href="https://github.com/nw4f/G3d">NW4F G3d decomp</a> has no documentation and needs a major refactor to work on 64-bit, the only other thing I can find is Switch Toolbox which is in C#.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
            ‚ö†Ô∏è Default portrait view isn't accurate to Wii U Mii Maker
            <ul>
                <li>Initialization is done here in ffl_app.rpx:</li>
                <li>FFLUtility: <code>FUN_0210a9b4</code> (I think)</li>
                <li>Wii U Mii Maker, US latest ver: <code>FUN_02086e9</code></li>
                <li class="small">Side note: I think this is very similar to the one Mii Studio is using, except it uses it for face AND face only. Comparison: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170521213000im_/https://cdn-mii.accounts.nintendo.com/1.0.0/miis/8ed7ef7660b3b2cf/image/1dd84ae2a599e70f-ebcc0c4f725b6b02.png?type=face&expression=normal&width=512&instanceCount=1&instanceRotationMode=model">Mii Maker/NNID/cdn-mii 1.0.0 (all the same)</a> vs <a href="https://cdn-mii.accounts.nintendo.com/2.0.0/miis/8ed7ef7660b3b2cf/image/1dd84ae2a599e70f-ebcc0c4f725b6b02.png?type=face&expression=normal&width=512&instanceCount=1&instanceRotationMode=model">cdn-mii 2.0.0/Mii Studio</a></li>

            <li>
            ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to find out how Miitomo adjusts colors...???? in order for it to be accurate
            <ul>
                <li>Because even though it uses the same Switch colors as we do, they pass in different color values, to the fragment shader.
                <li class="small">Happens for the LUT shader and mask shader (MiiDefaultShader). I couldn't find the colors in the binary, nor have I found where this happens yet. Wooohooooo...</li>

            </li>
            <li>
            ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to find whole body camera view for Wii U Mii Maker and potentially Miitomo (Mii Studio)
            <ul>
                <li>Unfortunately it isn't as easy as grabbing the MVP uniforms from Cemu as they do some optimization on the shaders that shuffles uniforms.</li>
            </ul>
            <details>
                <summary>üö© Missing a few parameters to be fully compatible with the Mii Studio API (read more...)</summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>characterXRotate, characterYRotate, characterZRotate
                    <ul>
                        <li>Difference between this and camera rotation comes down to model matrix vs view matrix, the only noticeable difference I've seen is in lighting.</li>
                        <li>Seems that most people use character rotation instead of camera rotation so, sigh, gotta figure this out...</li>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li>clothesColor
                    <ul><li>No reason I can't make this a hex color too. Also going to add "pantsColor" when that's a thing probably.</li></ul></li>
                    <li>instanceCount, instanceRotationMode</li>
                    <li>splitMode, splitDepthOffset(?)
                    <ul><li>Feel like splitDepthOffset doesn't do anything? It maaaay have done something on cdn-mii 1.0.0 though...??</li></ul></li>
                    <li>lightXDirection, lightYDirection, lightZDirection, lightDirectionMode(?)
                    <ul>
                        <li>I officially don't like the light direction parameters, I legitimately don't think anyone uses it right.</li>
                        <li>Both mii-js AND pf2m.com/tools/mii at some point used to initialize it to zero...</li>
                        <li>... while zero is not the default, so it just gives you a terrible result.</li>
                        <li>There's also lightDirectionMode, which cdn-mii 2.0.0/Mii Studio completely ignore. We don't know what its options do and, while setting it to "none" (the sites above were also doing this so eh where's the blame supposed to go) is SUPPOSED to not make the light directions apply, well, they do.</li>
                        <li class="small">Was light direction even a thing on cdn-mii 1.0.0...??? I feel like pf2m.com/tools/mii specifically said it wasn't.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li>Also IMO all of the above are straightforward to implement except for light direction, since that's not the real light direction uniform being passed to the shader (it would have more intense effects).</li>

            <li>‚ùîDon't have the body model used in Mii Studio at the moment. May be the same as Miitomo.</li>

            <li>‚ùîPoses from the Wii U Mii Maker are planned as soon as skeletal animations work.
            <details>
                <summary>‚ùîNeed to reverse the custom QR code format from Miitomo/Miitopia/Tomodachi Life.</summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>There's no reason this renderer can't support the custom Mii colors from Miitopia and Tomodachi Life, and it's proven that Miitomo is using some Switch format on 2.3.0 and later.</li>
                    <li>When all of those games encode the QR codes, they put downgraded 3DS/Wii U data in the beginning so that it can still scan on all devices supporting those Mii QR codes.</li>
                    <li>...However, all of those games are putting the game-specific data after that in the QR code, and I've taken a look, and it seems obfuscated or encrypted on TOP of the encryption Mii QR codes already have :\</li>
                    <li>I haven't personally taken a deep dive into this - it's definitely encrypted, with some <abbr title="Cryptographic term - Number Used Only Once">nonce?</abbr> or constant key at the beginning.</li>
                    <li>It looks like if you scan Miitomo codes in Tomodachi Life it will pick up on those extra details, leading me to believe that potentially all games use the same thing.</li>
                    <li>Neither of these games have debug symbols <span class="small">(despite that Miitomo has symbols for AFL/nn::mii on Android)</span> though so it's not going to be extremely straightforward to find, you'd have to do some memory debugging.</li>
                    <li><span class="small">Feel like if someone like <a href="https://github.com/jaames">jaames</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Kinnay">Kinnay</a> looked into this they'd be able to find it in a jiffy but, alas, we are just mere mortals üòî</span></li>

            </details></li>
            <li>‚ùîMay want to look into why the face texture looks more, blurry? on our renders compared to theirs.
            <ul>
                <li>Particularly at low resolutions like 96x96.</li>
                <li>Feel like they may be using either different texture filtering or a different texture resolution (unlikely).</li>
            </ul></li>

            <li>‚ùîMay look into doing a primitive shader. Potentially 3DS, Wii, maybe even both.
            <ul>
                <li>May require making the meshes/textures look worse for authenticity.
                <ul><li>Artificially using the shader, or by importing from CFL_Res.dat, or both?</li></ul></li>
                <li>Neither the 3DS nor Wii use traditional OpenGL-compatible shaders, though...</li>
                <li>... however, emulators eventually translate both to GLSL, and N*ntendo made a TEV emulator on Wii U.</li>
            </ul></li>
